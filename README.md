OAauth2 authentication module for Zotonic.
==========================================

At the moment this is just mod_oauth with different module and file names. It uses the same database tables as mod_oauth. It should work as usual (OAuth v1 authentication).
I have decided to make a generic Webmachine OAuth2 server before continuing with this development. Check my progress in https://github.com/IvanMartinez/oauth2_webmachine .
